## Introduction
In this assignment a ROS-based software architecture for a robot with surveillance porpouse is defined.  
It is based on the **OWL-DL** approach to create an ontology of the environment and it uses [SMACH](http://wiki.ros.org/smach) to implement a **Finite State Machine**. The ontology is made with Protégé and the architecture behaviour is based on [ARMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor).

Related documentation on the code of this solution can be found here:  

### Software tools needed
Use [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) to directly open and read the ontology used here while with [SMACH viewer](http://wiki.ros.org/smach_viewer) it is possible to see how the architecture behaves in run-time.

In order to correctly execute this possible solution, clone the [ARMOR API Client](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api) repository from EmaroLab (UNIGE) in the same workspace where this repository is downloaded. Then, copy and paste the following code in the `armor_query_client.py` file in the API `/scripts` folder:
```
def class_of_ind(self, ind, bottom):
        """
        Query which class an individuals belong to.
    
        Args:
            ind(str): an individual of the ontology
            bottom(bool): 
    
        Returns:
            list(str): the class of the individual
    
        Raises:
            armor_api.exceptions.ArmorServiceCallError: if call to ARMOR fails.
            armor_api.exceptions.ArmorServiceInternalError: if ARMOR reports an internal error.
        """
        try:
            res = self._client.call('QUERY', 'CLASS', 'IND', [ind, bottom])
    
        except rospy.ServiceException:
            raise ArmorServiceCallError(
                "Service call failed upon querying individuals belonging to class {0}".format(ind, bottom))
    
        except rospy.ROSException:
            raise ArmorServiceCallError("Cannot reach ARMOR client: Timeout Expired. Check if ARMOR is running.")
    
        if res.success:
            return res.queried_objects
        else:
            raise ArmorServiceInternalError(res.error_description, res.exit_code)
```
